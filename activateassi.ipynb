    "An activation function in an artificial neural network is a mathematical equation applied to the weighted sum of inputs received by a neuron. It essentially acts as a gatekeeper, deciding how this information is processed and ultimately influences the network's output. Here's a breakdown of its key roles:\n",

    "Introducing Non-linearity: Without activation functions, neural networks would be limited to linear relationships between input and output. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data that wouldn't be possible with simple linear models.\n",
    "Activation Threshold: The function determines whether a neuron's output is significant enough to be passed on to the next layer. It acts like a threshold, allowing only sufficiently strong signals to propagate through the network.\n",
    "Output Transformation: Activation functions transform the weighted sum from the linear combination of inputs into a meaningful output value. This output can be used for various purposes depending on the network's task, such as probability values in classification problems."

    "Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: Activation functions play a crucial role in backpropagation, the process by which neural networks learn by adjusting weights. The function's derivative determines how gradients (errors) are propagated back through the network during training. Some functions, like sigmoid and tanh, can lead to vanishing gradients in deep networks. This means the error signal becomes very small as it travels back through layers, making it difficult for the network to learn in earlier layers. ReLU helps alleviate this issue as it has a non-zero gradient for positive inputs.\n",

    "The Dying ReLU Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard ReLU sets any negative input to zero. While this avoids vanishing gradients, it can also lead to \"dying ReLU\" neurons.\n",

    "Softmax transforms the output vector from a neural network into a probability distribution for multiple classes. It takes a set of real numbers as input (often the output from the final layer of a neural network) and converts them into a probability distribution where the sum of all outputs equals 1. Each element in the output vector represents the probability of the input belonging to a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Uses:\n",
